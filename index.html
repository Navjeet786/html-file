<h1 style="color: black;font-size:50px;text-align: center; border: 4px"><u>New 7 Wonders Of The World</u></h1>
<p style=" text-align: justify; border: 2px solid"> Our world is filled with the most unique structures that are both man-made and natural. Some of the man-made creations include churches, tombs, temples, monuments, mosques, buildings and even cities. These structures have withstood the test of time and they continue to leave many awestruck with their brilliance. There are many in the world, but only seven are selected, which are deemed to be the best.
At present, as chosen by the New7Wonders Foundation, the Seven Wonders of the World are the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, the Chichen Itza, Machu Picchu, Christ the Redeemer, Petra, and the Great Wall of China. Added to the list is the Great Pyramid of Giza, though it is just considered an honorary candidate and not a wonder of the world.</p>
